# Linked-List
This project includes a basic implementation of a singly linked list in Java. The linked list is a dynamic data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal operations. The key features implemented in this project include:

Add Node: This function allows adding a new node to the end of the linked list. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

Get Last Node: This function retrieves the last node in the linked list. It traverses the list starting from the head and returns the node that has no successor.

Delete Node: This feature allows the removal of a specific node from the linked list. The node to be deleted is identified, and the list is updated to bypass the deleted node, effectively removing it from the sequence.

Reverse Linked List: This function reverses the order of nodes in the linked list. The head node becomes the tail, and the tail node becomes the new head, with all pointers reversed accordingly.
